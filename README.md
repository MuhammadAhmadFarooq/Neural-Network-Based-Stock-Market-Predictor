Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, LSTM, 1D-CNN, Transformer, Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit 
- - - 
Developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for stock price forecasting using OHLC data and engineered technical 
indicators such as RSI and moving averages. Implemented and trained LSTM, 1D-CNN, and Transformer architectures to 
capture different temporal and pattern-based features in time series data. 
Conducted rigorous backtesting on out-of-sample data using metrics like MSE, MAE, and directional accuracy. 
Deployed model outputs and analytics through an interactive Streamlit dashboard with support for CSV export, visual 
comparison of true vs predicted prices, and strategy-based return charts.
